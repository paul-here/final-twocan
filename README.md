## Work in Progress Notes

* GS - Generated Components for Home and Login, began scaffolding said pages
* Problems
- Sidenav not working, attempting to animate friends list so it can be toggled, nesting user functions within that menu as well. Abandoning the right hand menu design.
- Need to create the main chat window, my thought is that it should work as /home/{username}, similar to products in webstore.
- Animation Work, a lot of it, needs to be done.
- Created Login and Create Account as 2 seperate components.
- Friends and Groups(sidenav) are tables listing if they have messages or not.
- Buttons are connected to represent flow.
- View Message(is a modal/popup window) that would display current messages.
